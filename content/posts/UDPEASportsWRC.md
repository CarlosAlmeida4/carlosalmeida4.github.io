# How to get access to the data
EA Sports WRC was a completely new development using unreal engine, which I guess meant that all software from dirt rally to a new platform.
Therefore, it took some patches until the development team was able to push a way for users to get access to data.
Before the "official" data, some very smart people developed a [patch].

I decided to wait until the oficial release, which came out during [November 2023]
