# Introduction
I had to install a ceiling light for a corridor at my house, but I didnt like anything that was available at stores, thats when I found something I liked in a Poncha place in Madeira Island, so I decided to build something similar.

## Sourcing and Preparation
The first step was to source the needed components for something like this.

1. **Wood** - I went to a local lumberyard and found this rectangular piece of Pinewood
2. **Electrical Wiring** - I went with black braided cables, I bought a coil from a local supplier
3. **Light Sockets** - Also available from a local supplier
4. **Lights** - I found the ones I used at Ikea

I didn't want a treated wooden board, So the wood I got was a rough cut from the tree. But I still needed to make sure it lasted, So I sanded, cleaned and varnished the wood.

I also drilled the three holes needed to pass the braided cable from the top to the bottom of the wood

# Electric and Ceiling Support

The electric connections are simple, Its just a matter of joining all three lamps in parallel. 
Now the ceiling supports required a bit more thought. I decided to go with 4 support points using hooks.
The Blue shoelace is not part of the end installation, its was just there for prototyping.

Now we have the integration issue of "How am I going to make sure the ceiling anchors match with the supports I put in the lamp?
I solved this issue with construction carabineers. It allows some room for any misalignment between the wood and the ceiling.

# Final product
Im quite pleased with the finished product.

The feeling when a thought is transferred to something real is always amazing :smile:
